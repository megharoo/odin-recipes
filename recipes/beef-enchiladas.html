<ul>
  <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
  <li>1/4 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1 1/4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
  <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon taco seasoning</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  <li>2 1/2 cups enchilada sauce</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
  <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>8 flour tortillas</li>
  <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
  <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Gather ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and
    onion in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
    Drain and discard grease.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir 1 cup Cheddar cheese, sour cream, parsley, taco seasoning, oregano, and
    black pepper into ground beef until cheese is melted. Mix in enchilada
    sauce, chili powder, garlic, and salt; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low,
    and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lay a tortilla onto a work surface and spoon about 1/4 cup meat sauce down
    the center of tortilla. Top meat sauce with 1 tablespoon black beans and a
    sprinkling of black olives. Roll up tortilla, enclosing filling; lay
    seam-side down in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spoon any remaining meat sauce over rolled tortillas. Scatter any remaining
    black beans and black olives over the top. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup
    Cheddar cheese.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling, 20
    to 22 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
  </li>
  <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
